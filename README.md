# Google Places API - Address Autocomplete using dynamic script loading example

Just some boilerplate to add google places API address autocomplete to form inputs.

The code here is dynamically loaded which makes including it into content management systems without updating the header possible.  

While this is a bit heavy, it has its uses.  Alternatively, the dynamic loading can be removed and manual <script> inclustion in the head can be used instead.
